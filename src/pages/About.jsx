        About WAOC
      </h1>

      <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
        WAOC stands for <strong>We Are One Connection</strong>.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600">
        It began as a meme coin — not as a joke, but as an experiment.
        An experiment in shared attention, collective belief,
        and how simple symbols can connect people across cultures,
        languages, and backgrounds.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600">
        In Web3, memes are not meaningless.
        They are compressed expressions of emotion, values,
        and collective identity — carried by people,
        not controlled by institutions.

        Core Philosophy
      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-600">
        At its core, WAOC is built on five simple ideas:
        <strong> love, peace, unity, awareness, and shared destiny</strong>.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600">
        Love — as empathy beyond differences.  
        Peace — as calm within chaos.  
        Unity — as connection beyond identity.  
        Awareness — as seeing before reacting.  
        Shared destiny — as the understanding that no one evolves alone.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600">
        Beneath markets, narratives, and technologies,
        <strong>connection comes first</strong>.
        Before systems, before value, before belief —
        there is awareness.
      </p>

        Meditation as Practice
      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-600">
        This meditation space is not separate from WAOC.
        It is a quiet reflection of the same philosophy —
        a place to pause, breathe, and return to presence.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600">
        Less noise. Less control. More awareness.
        Not to escape the world,
        but to meet it with clarity.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600">
        No hype here. No promises.
        Just a moment of stillness —
        to remember that we are already connected.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm text-gray-400">
        WAOC Meditation is a non-financial, non-incentive experience.
        It exists as a cultural and philosophical extension
        of the WAOC community and its shared vision.
